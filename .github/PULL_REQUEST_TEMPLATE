# By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements.

Failure to properly do so will just result in the pull request being closed and everyone's time wasted. Please read it twice. Most people miss many things.

- I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/DavidLambauer/awesome-magento/blob/master/contributing.md).
- This pull request has a descriptive title. For example, `Add Name of List`, not `Update readme.md` or `Add awesome Magento list`.
- The entry in the Awesome list should include a short description about the list project/theme (not the list itself), and should be added at the bottom of the appropriate category.
- The list I added
	- is the result of hard work and is the best I could possibly produce,
	- is not a duplicate,
	- has been checked for inconsistent formatting, spelling, and grammar:
		- Each link description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
		- Drop all the `A` / `An` prefixes in the descriptions.
		- Consistent naming. For example, `Node.js`, not `NodeJS` or `node.js`.
